02/11/2019, 21:33 - Poornachandra: Hello guys.
          We should learn to be creative from the first day itself.
So, we need a few members who are good at concepts in C programming  and are willing to help everyone else in this.
It would be a wonderful coordination with the rest of the club.
 You would be just required to help others to understand the concepts they face difficulty in. For this week we have decided to go with C programming. Any C programmers in the group can reply. You will be taking up the role of mentors.

03/11/2019, 10:29 - Poornachandra: Guys..... 
We recommend everyone to have your own laptops. So it would be convenient for you in the journey of CODER'S club. If you already have a laptop and you feel issue during certain software installation then you can approach the technical team. If you want to buy new laptop but confused about which one to buy then can DM me.

Regard,
Poornachandra

06/11/2019, 08:43 - Poornachandra: Hello from the *inGenius and GirlsGeekHack Team*!

Here are some doubts that we want to clarify:

*1. Is this a 24 hour event? Do I need to stay the entire night?*

It is a 24 hour event, but you have the option of leaving on 6PM the first day and coming back the next day at 6AM. Any number of members of the team or even all members can leave for the night and come back the next day.

 *2. Is this event open to only CSE Students?*

No, it is open to all college students of any branch and degree. Anyone can submit their idea and come and build their project at the event.

*3. What kind of ideas do I have to submit? Does the idea have to be ready?*

You can submit any idea as long as it's related to technology in some way. You don't even have to have a software project!  (Although we encourage you to learn to code!). We have no restriction on the type of idea - you can work on any problem statement you want and use any tools you want. 

Some example technologies (we are listing a few, you can work on ones not listed here as well!) are Application Development, Machine Learning, Blockchain, Cybersecurity, AR/VR, Drones and Robotics, Internet of Things (IoT) and other Hardware hacks. 

You can work on problems from any field. Listing a few here: Healthcare (both physical and mental health), Finance, Environment, Problems in Cities, solutions for the differently-abled, Education, etc

06/11/2019, 23:34 - Gagan: Stdio stands for *standard input output* 

Basically v use this for printf n scanf...

So whenever u get "segmentation fault" it's mostly bcoz u might have made some mistake in printf or scanf statement... 
For example: when u forget to give '&' in scanf
06/11/2019, 23:34 - Gagan: Good one

06/11/2019, 23:41 - Chandrashekar: But possible tomorrow
06/11/2019, 23:41 - Poornachandra: Checking the code for start to end how it works
06/11/2019, 23:41 - Poornachandra: That's ir
06/11/2019, 23:42 - +91 90804 00495: I means tat .. simply analysing the program o/p rather than executing
06/11/2019, 23:42 - Poornachandra: From*
06/11/2019, 23:42 - Poornachandra: Yes
06/11/2019, 23:42 - Poornachandra: Good night guys.....
06/11/2019, 23:43 - +91 90804 00495: No..getch () is an unformatted input function and it belongs to stdio.h
06/11/2019, 23:43 - Chandrashekar: Noo
06/11/2019, 23:43 - +91 97399 19109: Overview of C: Basic structure of C program, executing a C program. Constant, variable and data types, Operators and expressions.

06/11/2019, 23:44 - +91 90804 00495: Then ?..
06/11/2019, 23:45 - Chandrashekar: It just clears the program by reading at least one character
06/11/2019, 23:45 - Dawood Oxf: getch()'s function is just to hold output screen until you press any character
06/11/2019, 23:46 - +91 95918 65664: Good night people
06/11/2019, 23:46 - Dawood Oxf: defined under conio.h
06/11/2019, 23:46 - +91 97399 19109: <Media omitted>
06/11/2019, 23:46 - Dawood Oxf: I suppose it depends on compiler then
06/11/2019, 23:47 - Dawood Oxf: I tried in sololearn code playground. Didn't compil3
06/11/2019, 23:47 - Dawood Oxf: *compile
06/11/2019, 23:48 - +91 97399 19109: Yeah it is
06/11/2019, 23:48 - +91 97399 19109: Which is why I had to confirm
06/11/2019, 23:49 - Gagan: Oh ya... I remember now.... Amaresh told us to search in google what getch() isü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
06/11/2019, 23:49 - +91 97399 19109: It is a non standard io function while stdlib contains standard. 
So, getch is there in some compliers(new ones) while in some it isn't.
06/11/2019, 23:49 - Gagan: I'm sorry guys... My bad
06/11/2019, 23:50 - Gagan: But conio.h is not necessary for getch()
06/11/2019, 23:51 - Gagan: I was part correct.... 

I was wrong abut getch() defined in stdio.h
06/11/2019, 23:51 - +91 97399 19109: Nah, when I complied getch in the college computers, it didn't compile.
06/11/2019, 23:51 - +91 97399 19109: When you put #include<conio.h> it complied
06/11/2019, 23:51 - Gagan: It depends....
06/11/2019, 23:51 - +91 97399 19109: Yes
06/11/2019, 23:52 - Gagan: Same as main type...
In few just main() works n in few u have to use int main()
06/11/2019, 23:52 - Gagan: Depends on the compiler
06/11/2019, 23:53 - Gagan: Just to be safe....
I guess v shud use conio.h
06/11/2019, 23:54 - +91 97399 19109: Yep
06/11/2019, 23:54 - Chandrashekar: Hmm yes
06/11/2019, 23:54 - +91 97399 19109: Yeah, like cpp Droid doesn't support void main() for some reason
06/11/2019, 23:54 - Chandrashekar: So u guys have till arrays know? All know how to declare it?
06/11/2019, 23:55 - +91 97399 19109: Yep
06/11/2019, 23:55 - +91 90804 00495: S..
06/11/2019, 23:55 - +91 97399 19109: We've done sorting, searching, multiplication in arrays.
06/11/2019, 23:56 - Chandrashekar: Wat abt others who are not and from C background
06/11/2019, 23:56 - +91 83173 80313: Yeahhh
06/11/2019, 23:56 - +91 97399 19109: I was talking about what they taught in class actually
06/11/2019, 23:56 - Gagan: Guys learn how to trace array programs...

It will help u understand programs a lot....
06/11/2019, 23:57 - Chandrashekar: Tracing is imp **
06/11/2019, 23:57 - +91 90804 00495: Ya .. I'm from bio background... but I know .. hope that others too
06/11/2019, 23:57 - Chandrashekar: That's good
06/11/2019, 23:58 - Gagan: Next year.... U will have topics similar to arrays.... 
So tracing is damn impt
07/11/2019, 00:02 - Gagan: Sorting n searching is very impt.....

Know these concepts thoroughly.... 
3rd SEM u will have a whole chapter abut this....
07/11/2019, 00:03 - +91 97399 19109: Yeahh
07/11/2019, 00:04 - +91 97399 19109: In DS?

07/11/2019, 19:07 - +91 88049 17890: Instead of %d it should be %c because the input we are taking is a character not integer
07/11/2019, 19:07 - +91 97399 19109: %c should be used in place of %d
07/11/2019, 19:15 - +91 83173 80313: %c in the print statement is to be used to display a char instead of %d which is for int
07/11/2019, 19:38 - +91 90804 00495: %c should be written .. instead of %d at 2nd printf ... coz %d used to read integer and %c s used to read character .. here c is defined as char datatype
07/11/2019, 19:40 - +91 84313 90557: %c should be used in place of %d in print f statement
